# Business Management Demo
A full stack application that allows a user to create an account and sign in securely using Auth0. Once logged in, a user is able to manage and update their Products, Departments and Employees stored in a SQL Server database.

# Walkthrough

2.  Once a user is logged in, their Products, Departments and Employees will be populated from the SQL Server database using 
    Rest API technology.
    
    Note: *A new user will not have any stored Products, Departments or Employees.*
